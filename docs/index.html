Learning Manipulation-Invariant Image Similarity for Detecting Re-Use of Images in Scientific Publications
</p>

<hr>

<p>
    Manipulation and re-use of images in scientific publications is a recurring problem, at present lacking a scalable solution.  Existing tools for detecting image duplication are mostly manual or semi-automated, despite the fact that generating data for a learning-based approach is straightforward. The goal of this project is to determine if, given two images, one is a manipulated version of the other by means of certain geometric and statistical manipulations, e.g. copy, rotation, translation, scale, perspective transform, histogram adjustment, partial erasing, and compression artifacts. We propose a solution based on a 3-branch Siamese Convolutional Neural Network. The convnet model is trained to map images into a 128-dimensional space, where the Euclidean distance between duplicate (respectively, unique) images is no greater (respectively, greater) than 1. Our results suggest that such an approach can serve as tool to improve surveillance of the published and in-peer-review literature for image manipulation.
