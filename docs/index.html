	<h2>Image Forensics</h2>
</p>

<p>The Image and Data Analysis Core and the Office for Academic and Research Integrity at Harvard Medical School
   have an ongoing collaboration developing tools to identify re-use of images in academic publications.
   As widely publicized by venues such as Retraction Watch, this problem is of increasing relevance.
   Most of these manipulations are currently detected by humans subjectively, or using at most manual or semi-automated tools.
</p>

<p>
To tackle this problem at scale, our team is currently developing methods to determine if, given two images,
one is a manipulated version of the other -- and, in case they are, further identify subregions in the images
that provide matching evidence. Manipulations include a broad range of transformations representing common alterations
and obfuscations ranging from simple crop and rigid transformation to projective and nonlinear transformations,
histogram adjustment, or local alterations such as partial erasing, the addition of text and annotations, etc.
We therefore apply metric-learning approaches based on convolutional neural networks to produce similarity functions
which are invariant to these manipulations. These models are trained on a large database of synthetically altered biological
images and tested on real-world cases of image manipulation which were discovered in peer-reviewed publications.

<h2>Phase 1</h2>
	
<p>
In the first phase of this project, we implemented a siamese network model for duplicate detection,
and curated a dataset of synthetic images for training.
